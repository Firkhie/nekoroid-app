        <p>Welcome to Nekoroid!</p>
        <p>I created this website with the sole purpose of enriching my knowledge in the field of programming, focusing specifically on the JavaScript language, while also using it as a platform to showcase and build up my portfolio. Through this project, I aim to immerse myself in practical coding challenges, experiment with various JavaScript frameworks and libraries, and gain hands-on experience in web development.</p>
        <p>By incorporating the design inspirations from websites like <a href="https://kyou.id/" target="_blank" class="text-[#FC4B03] cursor-pointer">Kyou.id</a> and <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/20743352-Fashion-E-commerce-Landing-Page" target="_blank" class="text-[#FC4B03] cursor-pointer">Dribble</a>, I sought to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface for my website. However, I want to emphasize that while I drew inspiration from these sources, I ensured that all the code and content I used were either original or appropriately attributed to their respective sources, adhering to ethical and legal practices.</p>
        <p>I'd also like to extend credit to the self-designed API that powers this platform, providing essential data and images for the Nendoroids showcased. The Nendoroid details, including images and descriptions, are sourced from <a href="https://kyou.id/" target="_blank" class="text-[#FC4B03] cursor-pointer">Kyou.id</a> for reference and inspiration</p>
        <p>It is essential to clarify that this website does not generate any profits, and I have intentionally kept it ad-free and devoid of any commercial aspects. It exists solely for educational purposes and personal growth, with a focus on honing my programming skills and expanding my expertise in JavaScript.</p>
        <p>I would be more than happy to receive feedback and constructive criticism from visitors to improve the website continually. For those interested in reaching out to me, please feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:alfalakhie@gmail.com" class="underline">Alfalakhie@gmail.com</a> or find detailed contact information in the footer, specifically under the <span class="text-[#FC304B]">"Contact Us"</span> section.</p>
